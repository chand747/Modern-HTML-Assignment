List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML.

Solution:-
i) Properly Use HTML markup:
- It is important to place in an order that makes sense.
- If HTML of a page is messy or headers aren't used properly, users accessing a website with a screen reader will have difficulties navigating.
- The H1 elements should be used for main ideas on a page with subsequent heading(H2, H3 etc) to understand the page and relationship between the elements on it.

ii) Assign alt tags for images:
- Images on a web page provide great value to users.
- Assigning alt tags to images will provide a description of the images allowing users to understand the image through the use of a screen reader.

iii) Use colors carefully:
- It helps our users to easily distingush diffenent sets of information.
- The color blindness and other disabilities can make it difficult for users to find information.
- Colors play an important role in web design.
